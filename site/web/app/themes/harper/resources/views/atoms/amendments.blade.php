              <p>Amendment 1 creates a small property tax break for some owners of more expensive homes. It will also likely create higher tax rates for all (including everyday working Floridians) or big cuts to local programs that serve our communities' needs.</p>

              <p>If passed, this type of tax cut will decrease revenues, thus leading to a cut in services that are vital to serving our community. Amendment 1 would also make property tax a constitutional matter and thus very difficult to change in the future.</p>

                   <p>Amendment 6, also known as "Marsy's Law," removes constitutional protections for those accused of crimes and expands already existing protections for victims. Redefines "victim" in ways that will compromise the privacy of the victim who was injured, especially in domestic abuse and sexual assault cases. Allows for corporations/businesses to be considered victimes.</p>
                   <h2 class="title is-3">Why Vote No?</h2>
                   <p>"Marsy's Law" is being bankrolled by a California millionaire who's pushing this "victim's bill of rights" into states' constitutions across the country. In Florida, the amendment is supported by Senator Lauren Brook, whose dad is a lobbyist with GEO Group, the largest private prison and immigrant detention company in the country. Lauren has taken tens of thousands in contributions from this company.</p>
