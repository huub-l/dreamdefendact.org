            Lauren Book, the daughter of slimy lobbyist Ronald Book, takes thousands from the GEO Group, the second
            largest prison company in the world. She is the poster child for Marsy's Law, a corprorate authored ballot
            amendment seeking to give big business more (human) power in our legal system and lock more people up. She
            is considered by political circles to be a "rising star" in the Democratic Party. </p>

            Stephanie Murphy is an immigrant and "Democrat" that votes with Donald Trump 50% of the time, making her a
            top Democratic supporter of Donald Trump's agenda. In July, at the height of the conversation regarding
            Trump's family separation policy, Murphy voted (alongside Trump) for a bill expressing support of ICE and
            against calls for its abolition. She also voted in support of Kate's Law, a Republican anti-immigration
            bill attacking sanctuary cities.

            Donna Shalala is the quintessential "DINO:" Democrat in Name Only. She has contributed $21,500 to Florida
            Republicans running for state, local and federal offices over the past decade, including GOP and frequent
            movement-opponent Rep. Illeana Ros-Lehtinen. As president of the University of Miami, she was nicknamed
            "Donna Walmarta" for selling a parcel of environmentally sensitive University of Miami land to developers
            who plan to build a Walmart. While President, she blocked calls for raises by janitors at every turn,
            forcing them into a hunger strike that left many hospitalized. She also served time in the Clinton
            administration where the Washington Post labeled her "one of the most controversial Clinton Cabinet
            nominees." </p>
